This simple visualization looks at both the total population and the population of Black Americans in all 50 states in the U.S., plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Each territory is represented by bubbles. The position of each bubble is the intersection between the territory's total population and its Black population. The color of the bubble corresponds to the geographic region (as defined by the US Census Bureau). The size of the bubble represents the Black population density; the bigger the bubble, the higher the proportion of Black Americans in the territory's population.
